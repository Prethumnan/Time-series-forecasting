# Time-series-forecasting

## Introduction:
This project involves the analysis of a time series dataset with sales data. The purpose of the analysis is to identify patterns and trends in the data and make predictions using the SARIMAX model.

## Data:
The dataset contains the sales data over time. The data does not show any seasonality, meaning that there are no regular patterns or cycles that occur over a fixed period of time.

## Methodology:
The analysis is done using the SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors) model. The model is used to identify any patterns and trends in the data and make predictions for future sales. The SARIMAX model is a powerful tool for time series analysis, as it can handle both non-seasonal and seasonal data.

## Findings:
Despite the lack of seasonality in the data, the SARIMAX model identified a clear trend in the sales data. The analysis revealed that the sales have been increasing over time, with occasional fluctuations. The model also predicted a continued increase in sales in the future.

## Recommendations:
Based on the findings, the following recommendations are suggested for the business:

The business can continue to focus on increasing sales as there is a clear upward trend in the data.

The business should monitor and analyze the fluctuations in sales to identify any potential causes and address them proactively.

The business can use the predictions made by the SARIMAX model to plan for future sales and adjust their strategies accordingly.
## Conclusion:
The analysis of the time series sales data using the SARIMAX model provided insights into the patterns and trends in the data. Despite the lack of seasonality, the model identified a clear upward trend in the sales data and made predictions for future sales. The recommendations provided can help the business make informed decisions and plan for future growth.
